      <h2>What is a certified natural gemstone?</h2>
      <p>
        A certified natural gemstone is a stone that has been examined by an independent gemological
        laboratory and documented as natural, with any treatments disclosed. Certification provides
        a neutral record of the stone’s identity, measurements, and observed characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certification is not a brand label; it is a scientific report. For buyers seeking transparency,
        a certificate anchors trust and helps compare stones across the <a href="collection.html">diamond,
        sapphire, ruby and emerald</a> categories. When certification is needed, FACETRA can guide
        you through the process outlined on our <a href="certification.html">certification page</a>.

      <h2>How gemstone certification works</h2>
      <p>
        Gemological laboratories analyze stones using microscopy, spectroscopy, and standardized
        grading protocols. The final report describes whether the gem is natural or synthetic and
        specifies any treatments that affect durability or value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certification follows a chain of custody, laboratory testing, and report issuance. Review our
        <a href="certification.html">certification process</a> to understand what is evaluated and why
        it matters for the <a href="collection.html">core gemstone families</a>.

      <h2>How to verify gemstone authenticity</h2>
      <p>
        Authenticity verification begins with identifying the species and variety, then confirming
        whether the stone is natural or synthetic. Independent laboratory testing is the most reliable
        method because it uses instruments that detect growth structures and inclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For collectors buying <a href="collection.html">diamonds, sapphires, emeralds and rubies</a>,
        verify any seller claims with third-party documentation. FACETRA emphasizes clear disclosure
        and can coordinate formal verification as described on our <a href="certification.html">certification page</a>.

      <h2>How gemstone treatments affect value</h2>
      <p>
        Treatments such as heating, oiling, or filling can improve appearance or stability, but they
        affect pricing and long-term value. Ethical practice requires full disclosure so buyers can
        compare stones on a like-for-like basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment impact varies by gem type. For example, heat treatment may be common for sapphire,
        while filling can reduce durability in emerald. Certification reports document these details
        so buyers can evaluate value appropriately.

      <h2>How origin impacts gemstone value</h2>
      <p>
        Geographic origin can influence value when historical mining regions are associated with
        rarity, color standards, or collector demand. Origin opinions are not guaranteed for every
        stone, but when available they offer additional context for market positioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Origin conclusions are made using inclusions and trace-element profiles. A certificate with
        an origin opinion is a valuable reference for high-grade <a href="collection.html">rubies,
        sapphires, emeralds and diamonds</a>, especially when documented through an independent lab.

        A gemstone certificate lists identity, measurements, weight, and observed characteristics.

      <h2>How collectors evaluate diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, and rubies</h2>
      <p>
        Collectors evaluate gemstones based on color, clarity, cut, and carat weight, but also on
        rarity, origin, and treatment status. Documentation is especially important for fine-grade
        stones within the <a href="collection.html">FACETRA collection</a> categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond aesthetics, collectors look for consistency between the physical stone and its report,
        as well as transparency of the sourcing chain. Independent certification gives a foundation
        for long-term value and resale confidence.

<!-- ================= FAQ ================= -->

<section class="section-block" id="faq">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="authority-section reveal">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>1) What does “certified natural” mean on a gemstone report?</h3>
      <p>
        It means a recognized laboratory has confirmed the gem formed naturally and has documented
        any treatments or enhancements in the report.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Can a gemstone be authentic without a certificate?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, but a certificate provides independent verification that reduces risk and makes
        comparisons between stones more reliable.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Are all gemstone treatments negative?</h3>
      <p>
        Not necessarily. Some treatments are common and accepted, but they should always be disclosed
        because they affect durability and value.
      </p>

      <h3>4) How can I check if a report belongs to a specific stone?</h3>
      <p>
        Match the report number, measurements, and identifying characteristics to the stone, and
        verify the report with the issuing laboratory when possible.
      </p>

      <h3>5) Why do some reports include origin while others do not?</h3>
      <p>
        Origin requires additional analysis and is not always determinable. Labs only provide origin
        opinions when evidence is sufficient.
      </p>

      <h3>6) How do synthetic gemstones differ from natural stones?</h3>
      <p>
        Synthetic stones have the same chemical composition as natural gems but are grown in a
        laboratory, which affects rarity and market value.
      </p>

      <h3>7) What should I look for in a ruby or sapphire certificate?</h3>
      <p>
        Focus on color description, treatment notes, and any origin opinion, along with the report
        number and measurements.
      </p>

      <h3>8) Does certification guarantee investment value?</h3>
      <p>
        Certification verifies authenticity and treatment status, but market value also depends on
        rarity, quality, and demand trends.
      </p>

      <h3>9) How often should a gemstone be re-certified?</h3>
      <p>
        Re-certification is usually needed if the stone is recut, treated again, or if an older report
        lacks modern disclosure standards.
      </p>

      <h3>10) Is a digital report as reliable as a printed one?</h3>
      <p>
        Digital reports are reliable when issued directly by the laboratory and include a verifiable
        report number and security features.
